<p>The following is not a step by step guide for finishing the MP2 but it still may be useful for people putting together their first PCB. </p>
<p>Note: in this assembly we have not added any extra copper along the bus bars which is a common practice to increase the total amount of amperage used for these boards. Adding thicker bus bars is shown here <a href="../docs/HIGHER_AMP_ASSEMBLY.html">[LINK]</a>. However, <strong>we recommend that if you are going to solder bus bars on your MP2 that you begin with that step first</strong>. </p>
<p>There are MANY tutorials on how to solder and hopefully this is not your first rodeo. At a minimum you are going to need a high wattage soldering iron, decent quality solder, hopefully some flux remover and a multimeter to be able solder this board. </p>
<p>Looking at the top side of the board, it tends to be easiest to solder in the shorter parts first (so they rest flat on the bench when getting soldered in. So a possible order is:</p>
<ul>
<li>JST connectors</li>
<li>12V to 5V DC-DC converter</li>
<li>the larger 12V DC-DC converter</li>
<li>20 pin headers</li>
</ul>
<p>When doing the 20 pin headers...</p>

<h2 id="mp2-continuity-testing"><a class="header" href="#mp2-continuity-testing">MP2 continuity testing</a></h2>
<p>Before you're finished with soldering be sure to do some important testing of your board. One set of tests involved using a continuity checker on your multimeter. This is a <strong>short video</strong> to help you get started:</p>

<p>Hopefully you have experience powering up a PCB for the first time, but here a subset of things you can do when starting up the MP2. </p>
<p>Connect a switch or put in a jumper over on the <a href="pics/PCB_ASSEMBLY16.png">middle-left side of the board</a>. Then: </p>
<ul>
<li>First remove the pill from the MP</li>
<li>Connect your multimeter to GND</li>
<li>Apply power to VBat</li>
<li>Note that in some cases the DC-DC converter wont activate at &lt;42 volts</li>
<li>Test for voltages on the points shown...</li>
</ul>
<img src="pics/PCB_ASSEMBLY17.png" title="Voltage check">
<p>If youre voltages look good, power off, plug in the pill and hopefully you'll see a comforting power light on the pill.</p>
<h2 id="mp2-loading-the-firmware"><a class="header" href="#mp2-loading-the-firmware">MP2 loading the firmware.</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect the F405 pill from the MP2 board;</li>
<li>Search the internet and break a record ($2USD) for the most inexpensive <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=st-link+v2">&quot;st-link v2&quot;</a> in existence;</li>

<p>Items to note if you plan to run the MP2 at high amperage</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're using a hot plate or oven, add bus bars first</li>
<li>Design bus bars to attach to heavy gauge wire</li>
<li>Avoid bending, see below</li>
<li>The mosfests MUST get some form of heat sinking</li>
<li>None of this is easy for a beginner</li>
</ul>
<p>Soldering big bus bars to the MP2 board is challenging: the larger the bar, the more heat is dissipated from your soldering iron so smaller irons will not work; another issue is that if youre not careful it you can start tacking down your bar, the bar expands and puts a bending force on your PCB. In some cases this creates a dangerous situation where the PCB is bent and has an increased likelihood of breaking thea ceramic caps.</p>
<p>One method of soldering bus bars that works very well is to use a soldering oven or hot plate. Take the hot plate or oven up to ~270°C, let the bars, solder and PCB all come up to temperature and allow to cool slowly. Because the expansion coefficient of the PCB (which has a lot of copper) and your bars is very similar, heating them all to the same temperature seems to reduce PCB bending.</p>
<p>Some successful examples:</p>

<h2 id="how-not-to-do-it"><a class="header" href="#how-not-to-do-it">How not to do it.</a></h2>
<p>In this case the problem is the large tabs of copper are likely to break off from the board if they receive lateral force. </p>
<img src="pics/HIGH_AMP_ASSEMBLY03.png" title="dont do this">
<h2 id="department-of-overkill"><a class="header" href="#department-of-overkill">Department of overkill</a></h2>
<p>This is an example of using laser cut copper to add copper bus bars that solder directly to wires. Soldering was done in an oven. </p>
<img src="pics/HIGH_AMP_ASSEMBLY04.png" title="laser cut busbars">
<p>Messing with heat sinks sucks as much as all the other assembly. In this case laser cut aluminium was used, and then threaded to receive the heatsink bolts and &quot;High-Strength High-Temperature PEEK&quot; bolts were used for attaching to heatsink plate. PEEK is type of plastic and reliable in harsh environments up to 260° C. The blue stuff is 3M thermal pad (Mfr# 5583S-10). Normal human beings use kaptan tape and M3 insulation grommets. </p>

<p>Final assembly with 2.5mm solid wire supports that have been soldered to threaded, copper pads. 
<img src="pics/HIGH_AMP_ASSEMBLY06.png" title="assembly"></p>
<p>In addition to the added expense the downside of this method is soldering in all the MOSFETs with the big bus bars and phase wiring already in place is overly complicated.</p>

<p>Drain-source Breakdown Voltage (BVdss) refers to the voltage across the drain-source terminal that causes the drain current (ID) to suddenly rise. Drain-source on-resistance (RDS(on)) refers to the effective resistance between the drain and the source when the MOSFET is in the on state. RDS(on) impacts the max current rating of the MOSFET and the heat generated by the MOSFET is directly proportional to this value. RDS(on) is also associated with current loss. So when choosing a TO220 MOSFET package for the MP2, follow these values closely. </p>
<p>For MOSFETs on the MP2, you want:</p>
<p>BVdss = 20% margin over your battery’s max voltage 
RDS(on) &lt;= 4mOhm </p>

<h2 id="avoiding-parasitic-activation"><a class="header" href="#avoiding-parasitic-activation">Avoiding Parasitic Activation</a></h2>
<p>The gate of a MOSFET is insulated by a thin silicon oxide which results in a capacitance between the gate-drain, gate-source and drain-source terminals. The capacitance values are described by the Input Capacitance (Ciss) and  Reverse transfer capacitance (Crss) directly reflect the switching performance of a MOSFET. (Other factors like reverse recovery charge can also be considered). These Ciss/Crss capacitances form a potential divider between the battery and the MOSFET source. Much like resistors, they have the effect of pulling the gate up or down when the MOSFET switches. Figure 1 shows that when the gate voltage bumps above the threshold, current starts to flow and it short circuits the battery. This is a problem. Quoting <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NGAKFHYZfCwJLpQ9wMGC9iVUuzCymuSV/view">this document</a>, “parasitic, or unwanted, turn-on of the power MOSFET is a phenomenon which happens in the reality more often and can cause more damage then usually known. Its appearance often leads to the destruction of the MOSFET…”. To avoid unusual destruction from parasitic turn on, select a MOSFET with a high Ciss/Crss ratio. You are looking for something like what is shown in Table 1 -- as long as that data is true -- we have a ratio of ~200, and the MOSFET should be immune to parasitic turn-on. </p>
<p>Another consideration is the Gate Threshold Voltage (Vgs) which characterizes the voltage between the gate and source that will switch on the MOSFET. When Vgs is exceeded, the MOSFET turns on and Drain Current (e.g., &quot;ID&quot;) begins to flow. The Transfer Characteristics of a MOSFET shown in Figure 1, displays a knee in the curve around 4V which is good because at this level the MOSFET is more resistant to parasitic turn on.  But be careful -- a higher Vgs is usually at the expense of some RDS(on) -- which we want to minimize. </p>

<p>The MP2 uses a half bridge configuration shown in Figure 2 with two N-channel MOSFETs between Vbat and ground to drive each motor phase. The two half bridge MOSFETs are referred to as “high-side” and “low-side”. During its operation the high-side and low-side MOSFETs trade switching between each other in order to drive current to each motor phase. Shoot through refers to a situation where both high-side and low-side MOSFETs are simultaneously fully or partially turned on, allowing current to flow between Vbat to ground. Dead time, refers to the period of time between switching the MOSFETs to protect against shoot through. </p>
<img src="pics/MOSFET_PARAM03.png" title="Figure 2">
<p>Factors that control how quickly MOSFET switching also important to setting the correct dead-time. For example, depending on the selection of the parts you’re using, the MP2 may have 4.7 ohm gate resistor with 3 x 7.4nF capacitance. This combination of factors gives a time constant of 104ns. Turn on threshold is usually reached within 1 time constant and turn off in 1.5 to 2.5 time constant. MP2 users will therefore need at minimum 1 time constant dead time to avoid the high and low side MOSFETs coming on at the same time. There is additional resistance coming from the MOSFET driver which impacts switching, and the capacitance between the drain and gate (i.e., &quot;Miller capacitance&quot;) also reduces the switching speed.  Rise time for the MOSFET is also associated with Ciss as well as the package temperature. Taken all together, in practice, 3 time constants dead time is minimum, 4 usually optimal, and 5 is safe.</p>
<h2 id="snubber-resistors"><a class="header" href="#snubber-resistors">Snubber Resistors</a></h2>
<p>Surges of voltage between the MOSFET drain and source are able to feed back through the gate because of electromagnetic induction and parasitic capacitance resulting in unwanted oscillation, which is often referred to as &quot;ringing&quot;.  These transient voltages are shown in Figure 3. Ringing is inevitable with fast switching, but snubbers in the circuit reduce the overall gain of oscillation and will decay the oscillation more rapidly. Depending on the choice of MOSFET you select, the MP2 may not need snubbers, but as you can see in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_ANmKU4OLiC335F1DV1td9k-rrzCTln/view">MP2 schematic</a> it is equipped with snubber resistors (RS1, RS2, RS3) and capacitors (CS1, CS2, CS3). </p>
<p>In situations where you get ringing on the MP2, you will need to dampen the oscillation by choosing the R and C snubber values, and soldering in these components. (Dont panic, the footprints for these components are 2.0 x 1.2 mm.) Look at the behavior of the MOSFETs on the MP2 by running it at moderately high current, and putting an oscilloscope probe on the test points connected to the MOSFET gates. (The test points are labeled with “TpGS” on the schematic.) The ringing frequency will be in the 20 to 150MHz region. You then tune the snubber so that it dampens the targeted ringing frequency. To achieve this, set C to roughly half the MOSFET total Coss (output capacitance) and the R such that the RC frequency is equal to the ringing frequency. If that doesn't solve ringing problems, you may have to increase the gate resistors (labeled RG1-6 on the schematic) which currently are 4.7 ohm. Changing these resistors may also require modifying the dead time. </p>
<img src="pics/MOSFET_PARAM04.png" title="Figure 3">
<p>A practical example (text taken from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_ANmKU4OLiC335F1DV1td9k-rrzCTln/view">MP2 schematic</a>)
Rough approximation: RC = 1/2 ringing period, e.g. 30MHz ringing -&gt; 3ns period -&gt;1.5ns RC, 2nF 1ohm is a good starting point. Typically, C = 1-5nF, R = 0.5-5 ohms. The capacitor determines the power dissipated, the resistor dissipates the power. The highest damping factor usually where Csnub ~=Coss MOS.</p>
<p>Other MOSFET Properties: Switching Losses
Earlier we said RDS(on) is associated with the MOSFET’s current loss, which translates to a power loss in heat which can be described by this equation:</p>
<p>P=(√2xI)² x RDS(on)</p>
<p>Where I represents currents and the units for P is in watts. This is time shared between high and low side so a further division by 2 is required.</p>
<p>Switching losses are described by:</p>
<p>Vbus x Iphase x switching time.</p>
<p>Where Iphase is average (not RMS) and switching time will be measured using a scope. Body diode conduction losses are given by:</p>
<p>Dead time x Iphase(avg) x Vdiode x Fpwm x 2 </p>
<p>Where dead time is the effective dead time where both MOSFETs are actually off, ~200ns if set up well, Vdiode is usually 1volt, Fpwm x 2 is per phase. </p>
<p>Note, loss to the gate resistors is negligible and overall, RDS(on) usually dominates switching losses. </p>

<p>These MOSFETs have about 2/3 the gate charge of ones previously tested. This may result in ringing problems, and they may have excess dead time that will reduce sensorless startup performance and waste a bit of power.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="calculation-of-bldc-motor-parameters"><a class="header" href="#calculation-of-bldc-motor-parameters">Calculation of BLDC Motor Parameters</a></h1>
<p>The MP2 as well as other VESC-based systems provide the capability to measure motor parameters using the controller. For example, <a href="https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool">vesc-tool</a> collects several motor values from a connected motor and controller by selecting &quot;FOC&quot; on left panel, going to the &quot;General&quot; tab, and following the &quot;Detect and Calculate Parameters&quot; directions on that page. </p>
<p>So vesc-tool is great for retreiving parameters. However, in cases where you want to measure the parameters yourself or check if your VESC is gathering up the right numbers, this document is for you. </p>
<h2 id="preamble"><a class="header" href="#preamble">PREAMBLE</a></h2>
<p>Some notes before beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Expertise.</strong> This document assumes you have a reasonable understanding of concepts such as Ohm's law and inductance. It also assume that you're comfortable connecting up high amperage equipment which should be not any more complex than wiring your motor to a controller. You're also going to need to have a lot of familiarity with using VESC-based controllers. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment.</strong> In order to do what is described here you'll need the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>A multimeter</li>
<li>A current limiting power supply</li>
<li>A LCR meter</li>
<li>An oscilloscope</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll also need some way to turn your disconnected motor at a relatively precise rpm. More about that later. </p>
<p><strong>BLDC motor configuration.</strong> BLDC motors have two basic achitectures:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_wye_v_delta.png" title="Figure 1: motor configurations">
<p>If your BLDC has three big wires coming out of it, we are going to assume that motor is in Wye configuration for the sake of simplifying the math used here.</p>
<h2 id="resistance"><a class="header" href="#resistance">RESISTANCE</a></h2>
<p>The copper wires inside of a BLDC are long, and the resistance found in those windings is an important number. In some cases the resistance can be measure direcly with an ohmmeter, but cheap commerical ohmmeters often will not get down to the range needed to get a good value. Instead, perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the rated amperage of your motor</li>
<li>Select a value around 10% of this rating</li>
<li>Set your current limited power supply to your selected amperage</li>
</ul>
<p>Your motor has three wires -- these are referred to as &quot;phase wires&quot; and are connected to the the termination points of the windings shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>. Arbitrarily choose two wires, and connect them to your power supply. Note: the motor will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRXPFaZ0nJI">jump</a> and then freeze to a holding position when you connect the power supply.</p>
<p>Now, at the same connection point of each phase wire, connect your multimeter to measure volts (you'll probably need something in the millivolt range). Get a number. Your results may look something like this:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_resistance.png" title="Figure 1. Capturing resistance based on Ohm's law">
<p>Notice that it would NOT work well to use the measurement that is coming from the power supply itself. Better to use what your multimeter is telling you. The connection used for this measurement is referred to as &quot;phase to phase&quot; because you're actually connecting between two phases of the motor to get your value. Grab your phase to phase voltage, and use Ohm's law to calculate the resistance. In our case:</p>
<ul>
<li>R = V / I</li>
<li>R = 129 mV / 10A</li>
<li>R = 12.9</li>
<li>Convert to single phase resistance: R = 12.9 / 2, or 6.45mOhms</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inductance-values-lq-and-ld"><a class="header" href="#inductance-values-lq-and-ld">INDUCTANCE VALUES Lq AND Ld</a></h2>
<p>In our case we're going to measure inductance using an LCR meter. LCR meters measures inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R) and commercial meters are not particularly expensive.</p>
<p>Gathering inductance values requires that we find two important positions inside of your motor that have to do with the position of the stator coils and the rotor magnets. To find these positions you can use the power supply set at the values as before (or less). These positions are described below:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_Ld_Lq1.png" title="Figure 3. D-axis and Q-axis motor positions">
<p>Also see <a href="https://youtu.be/oRXPFaZ0nJI">this video</a> which shows a motor jumping around when the phase wires are connected to a power supply. The marked positions are referred to as d-axis and q-axis (note the above figure). Once you have these positions, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect power supply</li>
<li>Turn the motor to d-axis position</li>
<li>Set your LCR to measure inductance</li>
<li>Using the same phase wires as when connected to the power supply, connect LCR</li>
<li>Get a reading for Ld</li>
<li>Turn motor to q-axis position</li>
<li>Get a reading for Lq</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, the motor may have residual inductance, or something, that means it takes a while for the L value to settle. In some cases metalic desk tops and placement of hands on the motor have influenced the L value. Take your time, and shorting the leads on the motor also helps to settle residual inductance.</p>
<p>Your measurements for Ld and Lq are phase to phase. Divide by 2 to get single phase Ld and Lq. To get total L for the motor calculate their average, or L = (Ld + Lq) / 2.</p>
<p>In our example here we get the following; (notice the position of the motor in each of the pics):
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_Ld_Lq2.png" title="Figure 4. Ld/Lq results"></p>
<ul>
<li>Phase to phase Ld measure = 174 uH</li>
<li>Phase to phase Lq measure = 199 uH</li>
<li>Thus, for single phase:  Ld = 87uH, Lq = 99.5uH, and L = 93uH</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flux-linkage"><a class="header" href="#flux-linkage">FLUX LINKAGE</a></h2>
<p>You'll discover there is an abundance of ways to measure flux linkage out on the internet. In our case we're going to use an oscilloscope to emperically measure amplitude and period of the volts generated by your BLDC. From this we'll calculate lambda, which is the integral of volt x seconds. </p>
<p>To get this measurement you're going to need some way to turn your disconnected motor at a relatively precise rpm. You'll probably need to mount the motor, and then connect it to an electric drill or another motor. One method of turning a motor is <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/YvglKtxUaCQ">shown here</a>. Turn the motor and collect the output of the motor on your scope.</p>
<p>Connect the ground end of your oscilloscope to one phase of the motor, and the probe to another phase. Be sure to note the scope settings for volts / div for the amplitude and ms / div for period. Once you have all this extract values for Vpeak and period of your sine wave. Here's an example:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_scope.png" title="Figure 5. Oscilloscope measurements of BLDC motor output">
<p>The scope is set to 2V / div for voltage and and 5ms / div for period. In our pic, Vpeak = 5V, and period, or T = 28ms. The formula to calculate lambda is:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_lambda.png" title="equation for flux linkage">
<p>Note: your measurement for the scope is collected from phase to phase; however, this formula does not require that you convert to single phase lambda, the formula handles it for you. </p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-vesc-values"><a class="header" href="#comparison-to-vesc-values">COMPARISON TO VESC VALUES</a></h2>
<p>Let's compare these values to what was collected using a 75V 100A single ESC single ubox from Spintend. For the motor used here, this is what you get in vesc-tool by selecting &quot;FOC&quot; on left panel, going to the &quot;General&quot; tab, and following the &quot;Detect and Calculate Parameters&quot; directions on that page:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_vesc-tool.png" title="Figure 6. vesc-tool detection results">
<p>Comparing to our emperical values, we get:</p>
<img src="pics/MOTOR_PARAM_table.png" title="comparing results">
<p>These are values are very close. Note that your results are always going to vary based on your controller, wiring, and motor parameters. </p>
<p>(*) One exception is the resistance. In this example the resistance of the motor is relatively low and the discrepancy here is probably due to added resistance of the MOSFETs in the ubox. The MOSFET resistance would not be as significant for motors with a higher resistance. </p>

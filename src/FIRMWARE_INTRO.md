# GETTING STARTED: Install and Debug MESC Firmware

## Getting started
Install STM32CubeIDE from https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

On the command line clone the github repository using:
```
% git clone https://github.com/davidmolony/MESC_Firmware.git
```

Start up the STM32CubeIDE. A workspace area is used by STM32CubeIDE to store all of your projects. The first time you start STM32CubeIDE it will want to create a workspace, if you dont have one.

Create a name if needed, select "Launch" 

When the IDE comes up for the first time, it may show an information center.

Close on this feature.

The IDE may show a project explorer tab on the left, if you do not see the project explorer:

Window-->Show View-->Project explorer


The project explorer may show "Import projects..." select that, or if you do not see that function, try:

File-->Import...

An import selector should come up:

Set up General-->Existing Projects into Workspace, select Next

Browse for the top-level github folder you created, hit open the import function will show this:

Select finish. This should load a set of MESC projects into the Project Explorer, expand the top-level folder and you should see:

At this point if you select

Project-->Build All (or the icons on top of the IDE also help with builds)

you should see the IDE compile the MESC_firmware in all the sub directories.

When you select the .ioc file in the file browser this tool pops up. By working with the pull down menus on each pin, you can view or set the functions on that pin. This tool also allows you to change many other functions like the timers, UARTS, and ADCs.

## Debugging -- getting started

To connect up your pill, you will use the abundantly available ST-LINK V2 debugger, and get connected like this:

There are a couple of settings to watch out for in the configuration of the debugger. Make sure these parameters are set up:

Once your st-link is connected and the debugger is configured you can get started by hitting this button. Sometimes you have to use that button's pulldown menu to select the debugging style that you want:
